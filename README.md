# FreeAnimate
FreeAnimate is an easy-to-use GoAnimate Server Emulator that uses Electron. Unlike the original project, Offline can not be shut down by Vyond. Why? It's because everything is hosted and programmed to function locally, and no internet access is required, barring the initial download (and TTS at this time). This project is important for archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be far trickier without it. Besides the main feature of Offline, we have also added other additional features and improvements compared to the original GoAnimate Wrapper project, and there will be more to come, as Offline will continue to get additional updates in the future.



## Updates & Support
For support, the first thing you should do is read through the FAQ, it most likely has what you want to know. Alternatively, if you can't find what you need, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ar5q478KSM). Joining the server is recommended, as there is a whole community to help you out.

## Dependencies
This program relies on Flash and FFmpeg to work properly. Luckily, they require no download, as they have already been included in FreeAnimate.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
FFmpeg is under the GNU GPLv2 license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. Flash Player (extensions folder) and GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist.

## Credits
These are unaffiliated people they haven't directly done anything for the project but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about FreeAnimate, use the Discord server.***
